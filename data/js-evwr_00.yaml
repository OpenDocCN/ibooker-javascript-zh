- en: In 1997 I was a junior in high school. A friend and I were goofing around with
    the web-connected computer in our school library when he showed me that you could
    click View → Source to see the underlying code of a web page. A few days later,
    another friend showed me how to publish my own HTML. My mind was blown.

  zh: 1997年，我还是高中的一名初学者。有一天，一个朋友在学校图书馆里展示给我看，告诉我可以点击“查看 → 源代码”来查看网页的底层代码。几天后，另一个朋友教会了我如何发布自己的HTML页面。我的脑袋简直要炸了。
- en: After that, I was hooked. I went around borrowing the bits of the websites I
    liked to construct my own Franken-site. I spent much of my free time at the pieced-together
    computer in my family’s dining room tinkering away. I even “wrote” (OK, copied
    and pasted) my first JavaScript, to implement hover styles on links, which was
    not yet doable with simple CSS.

  zh: 从那时起，我就着了迷。我四处借鉴我喜欢的网站的各种元素，拼凑出了自己的“弗兰肯网站”。我大部分空闲时间都花在了我家餐厅拼凑出来的电脑前，不停地摆弄。我甚至“写”了（好吧，其实是复制粘贴）我的第一个JavaScript代码，用来实现链接的悬停样式，这是用简单的CSS还做不到的。
- en: And in a turn of events that I’ve come to think of as a nerdy and wholesome
    version of the film *Almost Famous*, my homegrown music site gained reasonable
    popularity. Because of this, I received promotional CDs in the mail and was put
    on the guest list at concerts. More important to me, however, was that I was sharing
    my interests with other people around the world. I was a bored suburban teenager,
    in love with music, and was able to reach people I’d never meet. That was, and
    still is, such an empowering feeling.

  zh: 还有一件事我想到了，我觉得有点像电影《几乎出名》，但这是一个书呆子和温暖的版本。我自己做的音乐网站竟然有了一定的人气。因此，我开始收到邮寄过来的宣传CD，并被列入了音乐会的贵宾名单。然而，对我来说，更重要的是，我能够与世界各地的人们分享我的兴趣。那种能够影响到我从未见过的人的感觉，至今仍然让我感到无比的满足和赋予力量。
- en: Today, we can build powerful applications using only web technologies, but it
    can be daunting to get started. APIs are an invisible background that serves up
    data. View → Source shows concatenated and minified code. Authentication and security
    are mystifying. Putting all of these things together can be overwhelming. If we’re
    able to look beyond these confusing details, we may notice that the same technologies
    I was fiddling with 20-some years ago can now be used to build powerful web applications,
    code native mobile applications, create powerful desktop applications, design
    3D animations, and even program robots.

  zh: 如今，我们可以仅仅使用Web技术来构建强大的应用程序，但是初学者可能觉得这些技术有些令人生畏。API是一个在背景中提供数据的看不见的力量。查看 → 源代码显示的是拼接和压缩后的代码。认证和安全性则是神秘莫测的部分。把所有这些东西结合起来可能会让人感到不知所措。如果我们能够超越这些令人困惑的细节，我们会发现20多年前我摆弄的同样技术现在可以用来构建强大的Web应用程序，编写原生移动应用程序，创建强大的桌面应用程序，设计3D动画，甚至编程机器人。
- en: As an educator, I’ve found that many of us learn best by building new things,
    taking them apart, and adapting them for our own use cases. That is the goal of
    this book. If you know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but are unsure of how to
    take those components and build the robust applications that you’ve dreamed up,
    this book is for you. I’ll guide you through building an API that can power the
    user interfaces of a web application, a native mobile application, and a desktop
    application. Most importantly, you’ll gain an understanding of how all of these
    pieces fit together so that you can build and create wonderful things.

  zh: 作为一名教育工作者，我发现我们许多人通过构建新事物、拆解它们并为自己的用例调整它们来学习得最好。这本书的目标就是这样。如果你懂一些HTML、CSS和JavaScript，但不确定如何利用这些组件构建你梦想中的强大应用程序，那么这本书适合你。我将指导你构建一个API，可以支持Web应用程序、原生移动应用程序和桌面应用程序的用户界面。最重要的是，你将理解所有这些组件如何结合在一起，以便你可以构建和创造出精彩的事物。
