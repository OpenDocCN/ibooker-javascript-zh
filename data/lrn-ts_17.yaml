- en: JavaScript has been around for a few decades at this point, and people have
    done quite a lot of odd things with it. TypeScript’s syntax and type system need
    to be able to represent all those odd things to enable any JavaScript developer
    to work with TypeScript. As a result, there are some corners of the TypeScript
    language not seen in most day-to-day code but that are relevant, even necessary,
    for working with some kinds of projects.

  zh: JavaScript 已经存在了几十年，人们对它做了很多奇怪的事情。TypeScript 的语法和类型系统需要能够表示所有这些奇怪的东西，以便任何 JavaScript
    开发者都能使用 TypeScript。因此，TypeScript 语言中有一些在大多数日常代码中不常见但对于某些项目来说却是相关甚至必要的角落。
- en: I think of these parts of the language as “extra credit” in that you could avoid
    them entirely and still be a productive TypeScript developer. In fact, for the
    logical types introduced toward the end of the section, I would hope you wouldn’t
    need to use them very often—if at all.

  zh: 我把这些语言的部分称为“额外学分”，因为你完全可以避开它们，仍然能成为一个高效的 TypeScript 开发者。事实上，对于在本节末尾介绍的逻辑类型，我希望你根本不需要经常使用，如果可以的话甚至不需要使用。
